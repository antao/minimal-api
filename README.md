minimal-api
=================

## Introduction

This sample project is build using the [minimal APIs] feature approach and demonstrates techniques you can use for integration testing
an ASP.NET Core 7 web application.

Minimal APIs are a simplified approach for building fast HTTP APIs with ASP.NET Core. You can build fully functioning REST endpoints with minimal code and configuration.

[minimal APIs]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-4/#introducing-minimal-apis

The sample application implements two endpoints: 
* GET - Quotes - Returns the latest price quotes in a submitted cryptocurrency code for USD, EUR, BRL, GBP and AUD).
* GET - Metadata - Returns all static metadata available for one or more cryptocurrencies. This information includes details like logo, description and links to technical documentation)

These endpoints rely on two data sources: 
* [CoinMarketCap]
* [ExchangeRates]

By default, it uses CoinMarketCap as data source.

[CoinMarketCap]: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/
[ExchangeRates]: https://exchangeratesapi.io/

The sample uses the following technologies:

* [Minimal APIs]
* [Swagger]

[Swagger]: https://swagger.io/

The tests available in the `tst` folder show how you can write unit and integration tests to help you get coverage of the
system-under-test, as well as give confidence that the changes you make
to an application are ready to ship to a production system.

The tests rely on the use of the following open source libraries and technologies:

* [coverlet]
* [FluentAssertions]
* [WebApplicationFactory]
* [xunit]
* [xunit Logging]

## Building and Testing

Compiling the application yourself requires Git and the
[.NET SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core "Download the .NET SDK")
to be installed (version `7.0.100` or later).

## Debugging

To debug the application locally outside of the integration tests, you will need
to create API keys to replace secrets for the `ExchangeRateApiOptions:Key` and
`CoinMarketCapApiOptions:Key` so that the services work properly.

> üí° You can create free keys with limited usage.
> 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit secrets to source control. Configure them
with [user secrets] instead.

## Docker
This solution can be dockerized, install a suitable version of docker for your computer/architecture and run the following command:

```
docker build --tag "exchange-api" --file "Dockerfile" .
docker run --rm --detach --name exchange-api
```

## Todo
* Use default interface methods (C# version 8 feature)
* Use `Span<T>` (C# version 7.2 feature)
* Add cache to `ExchangeRatesService` class 
* Modify cache results (currently caches the HTTP byte[] response) on `CoinMarketCapService` to avoid allocations and improve performance
* Benchmark
* Add resilience mechanisms
* Proper error messages
* Versioning
